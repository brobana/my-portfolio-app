# Bryan's Portfolio Website

This is my website project that I have coded and deployed as part of my personal learning. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) and [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). 

The live version can be seen [here](https://www.bryanobana.com).
